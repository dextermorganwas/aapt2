# stremio-art-bridge

A self-hosted artwork resolver/proxy for Stremio's **AIOMetadata** add-on. It brings the
Plex/Jellyfin "pick your own poster from ThePosterDB" feeling to Stremio by giving AIOMetadata
one URL per art type; this app figures out (and caches) the actual image behind the scenes.

**Provider chain**

- **Poster:** ThePosterDB (English, Show Cover for series, Variation = Original) → TMDB (English)
  → TVDB (English) → TMDB (original language) → TVDB (original language) → Metahub → TMDB's
  primary poster → TVDB's primary image.
- **Backdrop:** TMDB (textless) → TVDB (textless) → Metahub → TMDB's primary backdrop → TVDB's
  primary image.
- **Logo:** same as poster, minus ThePosterDB (it doesn't host logos).

ThePosterDB results are cached **forever**. Everything else is cached for a configurable number
of days and re-checked afterwards. All resolved art is downloaded once and served from local
disk, not re-fetched from upstream on every request.

The first poster request does **not** wait on ThePosterDB at all. It resolves immediately using the
rest of the poster chain and queues TPDb work in the background. If TPDb later finds a valid match,
it replaces the fallback cache entry so subsequent requests serve the TPDb asset. TPDb errors and
negative searches are persisted with retry/backoff state so the server does not hammer TPDb on every
request.

A small admin dashboard (at `/admin`) lists every item that's ever been requested, shows what
art is currently being served for it, and lets you browse everything each provider has and
pick a different one, or paste in your own URL.

---

## 1. Configure AIOMetadata in Stremio

In AIOMetadata's configuration, set your custom art URLs to (replacing the domain with wherever
you deploy this):

```
Poster:   https://your-domain.example/poster/tmdb:{type}:{tmdb_id?}&imdb:{imdb_id?}&tvdb:{tvdb_id?}.jpg
Backdrop: https://your-domain.example/backdrop/tmdb:{type}:{tmdb_id?}&imdb:{imdb_id?}&tvdb:{tvdb_id?}.jpg
Logo:     https://your-domain.example/logo/tmdb:{type}:{tmdb_id?}&imdb:{imdb_id?}&tvdb:{tvdb_id?}.jpg
```

The trailing `?` on each id placeholder is required — it's what tells AIOMetadata to blank the
placeholder instead of dropping the whole URL when that particular ID isn't available for an
item. This app parses whichever IDs actually show up and resolves art from any combination of
them.

## 2. Get API keys

- **TMDB:** create a free account at themoviedb.org → Settings → API → request an API key
  (the "v3 auth" key is fine; either that or a v4 Read Access Token work — see `.env.example`).
- **TVDB:** create an account at thetvdb.com → Dashboard → API Keys. TVDB is optional — leave
  `TVDB_API_KEY` blank and the app will just skip every TVDB step in the chain.
- **ThePosterDB and Metahub** need no API key; both are used via their public pages.

## 3. Configure `.env`

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your API keys. Every setting is commented — sizes,
cache lifetimes, timeouts, and concurrency (turn `MAX_CONCURRENT_FETCHES` down on something like
a Raspberry Pi, up on a beefier server).

## 4. Run it

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The app listens on port 8990 by default (change with `PORT` in `.env`). With `network_mode: host`, the process binds directly to that host port, so your reverse proxy should point to the same port.

All state (the SQLite database and every cached image) lives under `${DOCKER_DATA_DIR}/art-proxy`, which is bind-mounted so it survives container recreation/updates.

---

## Admin dashboard

- **Grid view** — every item ever requested, with a poster thumbnail and a badge per art type
  showing which provider it came from (green = auto-resolved, blue = manual override).
- **Search** — by title or by tmdb/imdb/tvdb id.
- **Item view** — for each of poster/backdrop/logo you can:
  - **Re-run chain** — clears the cached pick and resolves it fresh.
  - **Browse all options** — live-queries every provider and shows every candidate image side by
    side; click one to make it the override (cached forever, never auto-replaced).
  - **Remove override** — goes back to the automatic chain.

Set `ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` to enable the browser login at `/admin/login`. The session is a signed HttpOnly cookie. Set `ADMIN_COOKIE_SECURE=true` when using HTTPS (the normal reverse-proxy setup).

---

## Notes, limitations & things worth knowing

- **ThePosterDB has no official API.** This app scrapes its public pages the same way community
  tools like `artwork-uploader-plex` do (searches `/search`, walks `/posters/{id}` →
  `/set/{id}` → `/poster/{id}` to read the Language/Variation metadata). If TPDB changes its
  HTML, `src/providers/theposterdb.js` is the file to fix — it already has a regex fallback for
  each scraping step, but a big redesign on their end could still break it.
- **TVDB artwork type IDs** are looked up dynamically via TVDB's `/artwork/types` endpoint
  (matched by slug: `poster`, `background`/`fanart`, `clearlogo`/`logo`) rather than hardcoded,
  since those numeric IDs aren't guaranteed stable across movie/series records.
- **TVDB extended records:** the app reads the `artworks` array straight off
  `GET /movies/{id}/extended` / `GET /series/{id}/extended`. If TVDB ever stops including that
  array by default for your API key tier, `src/providers/tvdb.js`'s `getExtended()` is the one
  line to adjust (e.g. add a `?meta=` query param) — everything downstream already just consumes
  whatever ends up in `extended.artworks`.
- **TVDB matching currently requires an IMDb id** (it resolves a TVDB id via
  `/search/remoteid/{imdbId}` when you don't already have one cached). If AIOMetadata sends you
  a tvdb id directly, that's used as-is and this doesn't matter.
- **Metahub** only has one image per art type (no language choice), and is IMDb-id only — items
  with no IMDb id skip that step.
- **Concurrency / dedupe:** simultaneous requests for the same item+art-type are coalesced into a
  single in-flight resolution (`src/lib/singleflight.js`) rather than triggering redundant
  provider calls.
- **Graceful shutdown:** `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` stop accepting new connections, let in-flight
  requests finish (up to 15s), then exit — Docker's default `docker stop` behaviour works as
  expected.
- If literally nothing is found anywhere, the app 302-redirects to the placeholder URLs you set
  in `.env` (recommended, so Stremio never shows a broken-image icon) or returns a 404 if you
  leave those blank.

## 5. Publish this to GitHub + GHCR (complete walkthrough)

This section assumes you've never used Git before. You have GitHub Desktop installed, which is
genuinely the easier path here — you won't need the command line for any of this.

### 5.1 Create the GitHub repository

1. Go to https://github.com and sign in (create a free account first if you don't have one).
2. Click the **+** icon top-right → **New repository**.
3. Name it something like `stremio-art-bridge`. Choose **Public** or **Private** (both work
   fine with GHCR — see the note about package visibility in step 5.5). Don't check "Add a
   README" — you already have one. Click **Create repository**.
4. GitHub will show you an empty repo with a URL like
   `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stremio-art-bridge`. Keep this tab open.

### 5.2 Put this project's files on your computer

Take everything in the project folder you downloaded from this chat and put it in a folder on
your Windows machine, e.g. `C:\Users\you\stremio-art-bridge`. Make sure the folder directly
contains `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, `server.js`, etc. — not a subfolder.

### 5.3 Connect GitHub Desktop to that folder and the repo

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**. Sign in with your GitHub account if you haven't (`File` → `Options`
   → `Accounts` → `Sign in`).
2. `File` → **Add local repository...**
3. Browse to your `stremio-art-bridge` folder and select it. GitHub Desktop will say "This
   directory does not appear to be a Git repository" with a link that says **create a
   repository**. Click that link.
4. In the dialog that appears, the name should already match your folder. Leave everything else
   default and click **Create Repository**. GitHub Desktop has now turned that folder into a Git
   repo on your computer (this is completely local so far — nothing is on GitHub yet).
5. You'll now see the main GitHub Desktop window with a list of "Changes" on the left (all your
   project files, shown as new/added) and a diff view on the right. At the bottom-left, type a
   commit message, e.g. `Initial commit`, and click **Commit to main**.
6. At the top of the window, click **Publish repository**.
7. A dialog appears with the repo name pre-filled. **Important:** uncheck "Keep this code
   private" only if you actually want it public — either is fine. If you already created the
   repo on GitHub.com in step 5.1, instead of "Publish repository" you may see a prompt to
   choose an existing remote — pick the `stremio-art-bridge` repo you created. If GitHub Desktop
   instead tries to create a *second* new repo with the same name, that's fine too — just publish
   it, then on GitHub.com delete whichever of the two ends up empty/duplicate, or simplest: skip
   creating the repo manually on GitHub.com in step 5.1 and just let "Publish repository" create
   it for you here in one click.
8. Click **Publish repository**. GitHub Desktop uploads everything. Refresh the GitHub.com tab —
   your files are now there.

From now on, whenever you change a file locally: GitHub Desktop's "Changes" tab shows what
changed → type a commit message → **Commit to main** → **Push origin** (top of the window). That
last step, "Push", is what actually uploads your commit to GitHub.

### 5.4 Let GitHub Actions build and publish the Docker image

The workflow file at `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` is already in your repo (you just
pushed it). It needs **no configuration or secrets** — GitHub automatically provides a
`GITHUB_TOKEN` with permission to publish packages under your own account, which the workflow
uses to log in to GHCR.

It runs automatically:
- every time you push to the `main` branch (which you just did in step 5.3 — go check!)
- every time you push a version tag like `v1.0.0`
- or manually: on GitHub.com, go to your repo → **Actions** tab → click the workflow name on the
  left → **Run workflow** button → **Run workflow**.

To watch it work: on GitHub.com, open your repo → **Actions** tab. Click the running workflow to
see live logs. The first run takes a few minutes (it builds for both Intel/AMD and ARM). A green
checkmark means your image is now published.

### 5.5 Make the package pullable

1. On GitHub.com, go to your repo's main page. In the right sidebar you should see a
   **Packages** section with your image listed once the first workflow run finishes — click it.
2. On the package page, click **Package settings** (gear icon, or via the "..." menu).
3. If your repo is private, or if you just want to be able to `docker pull` without logging in,
   scroll to **Danger Zone** → **Change visibility** → set to **Public**. (If you're fine with
   authenticating Docker to GHCR on your server instead, you can skip this and use
   `docker login ghcr.io` there with a
   [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) that has `read:packages` scope.)
4. While you're on the package settings page, under **Manage Actions access**, confirm your repo
   is listed (it should be automatically) so future pushes keep permission to publish new
   versions.

### 5.6 Deploy on your Docker server

On your Linux server:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/stremio-art-bridge && cd ~/stremio-art-bridge
# Grab just the two files you need to run the published image (or copy your whole repo, either works):
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stremio-art-bridge/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stremio-art-bridge/main/.env.example
mv .env.example .env
nano .env   # fill in your TMDB/TVDB keys etc.
```

Edit `docker-compose.yml`:
- Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` in the `image:` line with your actual GitHub username (all
  lowercase — GHCR requires lowercase image names).
- Delete or comment out the `build: .` line now that you're pulling a pre-built image.

Then:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```

Visit `http://your-server-ip:8990/admin` to confirm it's running, then point AIOMetadata at
`http://your-server-ip:8990/poster/...` etc. (or a domain/reverse-proxy in front of it).

### 5.7 Updating later

Whenever you (or I, in a future chat) change the code: commit + push in GitHub Desktop as in
5.3 → Actions rebuilds and republishes the `latest` tag automatically → on your server, just run
`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` again to pick up the new image.

## Resolver behavior

A first poster request does not wait for ThePosterDB. The live resolver follows the configured TMDB/TVDB/Metahub fallback chain immediately while a low-priority ThePosterDB job searches in the background. A successful ThePosterDB poster is then stored with an indefinite TTL and becomes the selected poster until a manual override or an intentional re-resolve.

Cache-Control is adaptive for fallback posters: the client cache is short while TPDb has not completed, is capped by the next TPDb retry after a miss/error, and becomes long-lived/immutable for TPDb or manual overrides.

The admin UI shows the selected provider, selection stage, reason, language, cache status and ThePosterDB retry state. It also exposes provider candidates for manual selection.
